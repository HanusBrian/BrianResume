This is a "mock website" to display some of my current accomplishments.

# Frameworks

I am currently using basic js, css, and html5 to create this project.  I am also playing with grunt for development and auto-refresing the site during development.  jQuery is being used for the landing page and calls to the quotes and there is some Bootstrap for styling some of the pages.
